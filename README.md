# Hydracraft Portal Site

This is the source code of the Hydracraft Project, which stills on progress developing.

This repository is only the **front**-end code. The **back-end** is still on progress, but I'll upload it complete once I finished it.

## Here are the designs I made using Figma for the design of the project.

## Usage

To start, you need to download Node JS from their [official website](https://nodejs.org/es "website").
Once's installed, you can now copy this repository into your local files.

Install the dependencies using `npm i --save` and then run the server using: `npm run dev`.

This will start the front-end server which will let you open the website in your navigator.

## Contact
